# AdminScriptActivation
Part 2 of the Admin script setup


Make sure your GUI is set up like this(Go to the ss.png in the repo), I don't care about the positioning.

And for the localscript: Copy/Paste the script in the repo(Activation.lua)

For the rainbow effect in most Admin Panels, simply insert this localscript inside whatever GUI you want.
